# Golf Quiz

For this project I have created a golf quiz using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There will be a total of 10 questions and you have to try and get as many correct as possible. This website is for you trivia enthusiasts, especially if you are into sports!

## Features

- The website contains a header at the top of the page letting the user know they are about to take a golf quiz.

There were no bugs found in the code. I had problems when creating the form as the 'Your feedback has been recorded.' message wouldn't display but I managed to fix that error.


## Deployment

I published my project on GitHub pages. I followed [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to help me do it.
